# Please Message Me on Teams When Tagging Me in ADO


## TL;DR
When tagging someone in an ADO work item, it’s important to follow up with a message on Teams. This ensures your colleague sees your request promptly and reduces the risk of important work being missed. Don’t assume a tag alone will suffice; communication should be both efficient and noticeable to keep work flowing smoothly.

## ADO Tag Etiquette
```text
Scenario 1: 2024-09-27 10:00:00 you: [Tags colleague in ADO item]
#WAITING WHILE COLLEAGUE NOTICES ADO TAG HOURS LATER
2024-09-27 14:00:00 colleague: [Just noticed tag in ADO] Hey, I saw the tag. How can I help?
2024-09-27 14:01:00 you: I was wondering if you could review the changes I made to [some part].
```
This delay could have been avoided with a quick follow-up message on Teams.

Instead, try this:

```text
2024-09-27 10:00:00 you: [Tags colleague in ADO item]
2024-09-27 10:01:00 you: [Sends quick message on Teams]
“Hey! I’ve tagged you in an ADO work item regarding [task/feature]. Could you check it out when you get a chance?”
```

In this version, your colleague is immediately aware of the request, allowing them to prioritize accordingly.

## Why This Matters
Tagging someone in an ADO item is not always enough, especially in busy work environments where notifications can be missed or delayed. A simple message on Teams adds a human touch and ensures that your request doesn’t get buried. It's an easy step to improve communication and productivity.

Example of a Good Teams Follow-up
2024-09-27 10:00:00 you: [Tags colleague in ADO]
2024-09-27 10:01:00 you: [Sends message on Teams]
“Hi! I tagged you in ADO regarding [specific task]. Could you take a look when possible?”
```
This approach respects the recipient’s time, provides context, and ensures your request isn’t overlooked. It also promotes efficient, asynchronous communication.

## Key Takeaways:
Tagging in ADO alone might not always grab attention.
A quick Teams message alongside the ADO tag helps ensure prompt action.
Communicating effectively reduces wait time and potential miscommunication.
